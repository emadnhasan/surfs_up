# SURF'S UP

# Overview
    
   The purpose of this analysis was to determine how successful a surf/ice cream shop would be in Oahu, Hawaii. This is done by analyzing the temperature trends in Oahu to determine if the climate would be condusive to this kind of business. June and December temperatures were used in order to get a full spectrum of data. These results could then be expanded to see th viability of such a business in other locations.

* The average June and December temperatures were 75 and 71 respectively. This 4 degree difference is rather marginal.
* The lowest June and December temperatures were 64 and 56 respectively. Although this is an 8 degree difference, it still does not seem to be a significant change
* The maximum June and Decemeber temperatures were 85 and 83. This 2 degree difference can be seen as inconsequential.


# Summary

The average temperatures in the two months studied both appear to be in the threshold for a surf and ice cream shop. The same holds true for the min and max temperatures. This indicates that the temperature should not be a factor for the success of the business.
